"8 room luxury Villa for sale in Palm Jumeirah Rd - Dubai - Emirati Arabi Uniti, Dubai ","12,500,000€",940 m²,8,"From our simple beginnings with a single resort in 1995, Six Senses is now recognized as a pioneer of sustainable practices, demonstrating that uncompromisingly gorgeous hideaways can live in harmony with local communities and ecosystems. Today, we uphold this same ethos across 17 hotels and resorts and 26 spas in 20 countries under the brand names Six Senses, Evason and Six Senses Spas, as well as a further 34 properties in the development pipeline. Each property has a distinctive and locally inspired design personality, which makes smart and responsible use of the natural land topography and materials. Owning a piece of the extraordinary Six Senses lifestyle is also made possible with Six Senses Residences, for indulgent living as nature intended. CREATING PLACES THAT RECONNECT PEOPLE The Six Senses brand was born from the belief that to live is to connect. Experiencing true connection means detaching from life’s distractions so that we can awaken our senses and open our hearts and minds to the truth of our feelings, each other, nature and the power of now.Our enduring vision remains as strong as ever: To help people reconnect with themselves, others and the world around them.As Six Senses expands, we consistently demonstrate that wellness and sustainability are at the heart of what we do. Our DNA can be successfully replicated across a broad property portfolio, from our original rustic vibe to edgy design and urban splendor. That’s because, with Six Senses, reconnection can happen anywhere: on a remote private island, snowy mountain hideaway, desert dune, lush forest, rugged tundra, wine estate or in the middle of a lively lounge in the city. Wherever and however people encounter us – and whether they spend an hour or a season – our aim is for them to leave us in a better place than when they arrived. EMOTIONAL HOSPITALITYWe bring a Six Senses community to our spaces and places. This reflects our emotional hospitality and the way we combine the natural magic of each location with our optimistic and compassionate attitude to everyone.LOCAL SENSITIVITY, GLOBAL SENSIBILITYWhile maintaining a global outlook, we are rooted in local concerns and cultures. Our operations work with artisans, farmers, producers and suppliers who live nearby. Our guests don’t just observe local culture, they immerse in it, and ultimately become part of it. 2FUN AND QUIRKYFun and quirky aren’t values you would ordinarily associate with the hospitality and wellness business. Our curiosity and desire to explore allow us and our guests to discover unexpected ways to reconnect every single day.CRAFTED EXPERIENCESIt isn’t what you do but how you feel about it that makes the difference. From fire circles to feasts or fashion weeks, chanting with monks or close encounters with wildlife, there are many ways to stimulate, energize and restore through “Pinch me, did that just happen?” moments. PIONEERING WELLNESSOur unique wellness experience blends ancient health wisdom with groundbreaking biohack technology. We don’t follow the fads but do our own research to pioneer signature standards, wellness programs (sleep, nutrition, longevity, movement, energy medicine, and alternative therapies) and longer-stay immersive retreats. The strong sense of community and togetherness propels guests towards achieving their goals, so they leave with a peaceful mind, a strong and healthy body and friends for life. RESPONSIBLE AND CARINGWe are thoughtful about what we are doing and why, and how we impact our physical world and those around us. Sustainable properties call for extraordinary creativity and design, they need to be good quality and they need to be made from exceptional materials. Far from being a barrier, taking an ecological and sustainable approach to our developments and operations adds meaning, drives innovation, enhances local socio-economic development and creates a hospitality offering that our guests trust and love. EAT WITH SIX SENSESOur chefs are guided by the principles of natural ingredients, local and sustainable and less is more –filling up on hearty, healthy and homegrown menus and removing the bad stuff from our dishes and plastic and waste from our kitchens. SLEEP WITH SIX SENSESBecause the importance of sleep goes way beyond just banishing under-eye circles, we’ve worked with internationally renowned experts including Sleep Doctor Michael J. Breus to bring together some of the best sleeping tools. From handmade mattresses and temperature regulating bedding to organic cotton sheets, sleep apps and more, we provide ideal conditions for a restful slumber while at Six Senses and share additional knowledge for restorative sleep back home. GROW WITH SIX SENSESOur children’s activities promote positive well-being by incorporating the six dimensions of wellness: social, environmental, physical, spiritual, emotional and intellectual. From flying yoga and cooking workshops to yoga, spa treatments, upcycling, arts and crafts, the focus is switching off the devices and switching on the fun. 3EARTH LABSAt Six Senses, our passion for sustainable living is group wide. Each property communicates the work they do on and off site at the Earth Lab. Around the world, we’re involved in community outreach, wildlife, plant, soil and water conservation, farm-to-fork initiatives, zero waste, upcycling, and bottling our own drinking water, saving around 2 million plastic bottles a year.ALCHEMY BARSThis is the place to discover exotic potions of herbs, salts and fruits, and essential oils that can be blended up to make aromatic scrubs and masks using fresh, seasonal and organic ingredients from our gardens.

This is one of the most magnificent luxury properties currently available in Dubai. What started as a true passion project has evolved into a one-of-a-kind, ultra-chic mansion villa that would be considered a work of art by the experts at Architectural Digest or Vogue. Forged from the genius of Italian architect Frederico Spagnulo, no expense has been spared and no detail has been overlooked in curating this breath-takingly impressive family home that exudes just the right level of charm and grace in a sophisticated modern era. Its exquisite finish is truly international in standards and includes Italian marble and tiling, Swedish wood flooring, Belgium fireplaces and carpeting, American veneered panelling, a large bespoke english lawyer desk, a German/Swiss spa, American/Germankitchen appliances, a UK indoor speaker system, a Canadian outdoor speaker system, a gun-metal crystal drop chandelier and a bespoke spiral staircase by an accomplished Iranian artisan with works in the Gugenheim museum in NY. Built over four floors, the home is perfectly styled to maximise its connection with the oasis of the greenery and calmness of a Dubai community. The effortless transitions from indoor to outdoor really enhances the everyday quality of the home and although it currently has seven bedrooms, there is the opportunity to expand to nine if the buyer would like. Since this palatial home is clearly destined for a powerful and cosmopolitan buyer, it has been built to include a series of unique touches that will speak to those who appreciate the finer aspects of life. As well as a three-car air-conditioned garage, large driveway and staff quarters for up to seven, the home also comes with an outstanding fully equipped 860 sq. ft. private gym with 4 m high ceilings that looks out to Burj Khalifa, a private cinema, fully integrated Vantage smart home automation with integrated Texecom security system, a knife-edge outdoor pool with a sunken seating area at one end that comfortably seats 16 people around a gas lit fire pit, to an in-built German Olympic-level swimming current machine and large lounge/dining pergola at the other end and an exquisite five-star luxury 1,000 sq. ft. spa that could be ripped from the levels of a stunning Swiss boutique hotel with sauna, steam room, vitality pool, 10 degrees ice pool, massage room, salon room and a gas fireplace feature wall. The design of the home was clearly intended to mirror the indulgence of a five-star hotel and has been brought to life over three years by a team of experts that understand the finesse that is required to reach the highest standards of living for ultra-VIPs.

"Luxury Villa for sale in Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Price in application,12,7,"Luxhabitat Sotheby’s International Realty is truly honoured to showcase this exceptional 7-bedroom villa in Dubai. This is one of the most magnificent luxury properties currently available in Dubai. What started as a true passion project has evolved into a one-of-a-kind, ultra-chic mansion villa that would be considered a work of art by the experts at Architectural Digest or Vogue. Forged from the genius of Italian architect Frederico Spagnulo, no expense has been spared and no detail has been overlooked in curating this breath-takingly impressive family home that exudes just the right level of charm and grace in a sophisticated modern era. Its exquisite finish is truly international in standards and includes Italian marble and tiling, Swedish wood flooring, Belgium fireplaces and carpeting, American veneered panelling, a large bespoke english lawyer desk, a German/Swiss spa, American/German kitchen appliances, a UK indoor speaker system, a Canadian outdoor speaker system, a gun-metal crystal drop chandelier and a bespoke spiral staircase by an accomplished Iranian artisan with works in the Gugenheim museum in NY. Built over four floors, the home is perfectly styled to maximise its connection with the oasis of the greenery and calmness of a Dubai community. The effortless transitions from indoor to outdoor really enhances the everyday quality of the home and although it currently has seven bedrooms, there is the opportunity to expand to nine if the buyer would like. Since this palatial home is clearly destined for a powerful and cosmopolitan buyer, it has been built to include a series of unique touches that will speak to those who appreciate the finer aspects of life. As well as a three-car air-conditioned garage, large driveway and staff quarters for up to seven, the home also comes with an outstanding fully equipped 860 sq. ft. private gym with 4 m high ceilings that looks out to Burj Khalifa, a private cinema, fully integrated Vantage smart home automation with integrated Texecom security system, a knife-edge outdoor pool with a sunken seating area at one end that comfortably seats 16 people around a gas lit fire pit, to an in-built German Olympic-level swimming current machine and large lounge/dining pergola at the other end and an exquisite five-star luxury 1,000 sq. ft. spa that could be ripped from the levels of a stunning Swiss boutique hotel with sauna, steam room, vitality pool, 10 degrees ice pool, massage room, salon room and a gas fireplace feature wall. The design of the home was clearly intended to mirror the indulgence of a five-star hotel and has been brought to life over three years by a team of experts that understand the finesse that is required to reach the highest standards of living for ultra-VIPs. The entrance has a vast nine metre ceiling, and the room heights range from 3.6m to 4.5m creating a magnificent sense of space. The home is also beautifully appointed with a fluid functionality between the family areas and those grand enough for entertaining. From the bespoke wood and textured marble dining table that can seat 12 to the formal sitting room, the entertainment area to the sunken firepit seating space, there are ample opportunities for the residents to show off their impressive abode and host beloved friends and family. The large scale of this dynamic luxury property is vivacious in spirit, but balanced by incredible design elements and a homely atmosphere. A true masterpiece of artistry and design, the villa is warm and elegant, with bespoke style and unrivalled privacy, all while being housed in, one of the city’s most revered communities. Given its illustrious location, the designers of the villa wanted to ensure they had made the most of their surroundings. The exterior of the villa includes a vast garden with a dual-use summer/winter luxury garden pergola with hidden minimal German glass sliding window system that is perfect for escaping the summer heat.                            </span>",Missing,https://www.luxuryestate.com/a10359361-luxhabitat-sotheby-s-international-realty
